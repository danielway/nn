# nn

A collection of scripts and notebooks from my exploration of neural-networking. For this study, I'm consulting a collection of whitepapers and some lectures by Andrej Karpathy.

## grad_descent.ipnyb / value.py / nn.py

Basic Autograd-type engine implementing backpropogation over a scalar DAG and minimial neural network library. Inspired by [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and intended as a learning instrument.
